print('This is the "guess a number" game.\nYou try to guess a random number in the smallest number of attempts.')

# Prompt the user for how difficult the game will be. Ask for an integer

# Generate a random number between 1 and the chosen value
value_max = 100
value_random = random.randint(1, value_max)

# Give the user instructions as to what he or she will be doing

# Initialize the sentinal and the array of guesses

# Give the user a report: How many guesses and what the guesses where
