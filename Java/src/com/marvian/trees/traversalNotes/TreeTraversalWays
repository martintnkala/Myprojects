Ways of traversing a Tree.

1. Level:
    - Visit nodes on each level(left to right)
2. Pre-Order:
    - Visit the root of every subTree first(root, left, right)
3. Post-Order:
    - Visit the root of every subTree last(left, then right, then root)
    - Do the left side first.
4. In-Order:
    - Visit left child, then root, then right child
    - It is sorted.
